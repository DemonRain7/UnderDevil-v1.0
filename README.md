# UnderDevil-v1.0
This game was a project I created almost entirely on my own during my first semester of college. As someone who loves gaming, I wanted to challenge myself to make something fun and engaging. It was an incredible learning experience, and Iâ€™m proud to share the result with you!

### Game Instructions:
1. **Art Style**: The gameâ€™s visuals are inspired by the famous pixel game *Undertale*. The black background isnâ€™t laziness, we promise!  
2. **Starting the Game**: Wait for the loading screen to finish, then click on the screen to start the game.  
3. **Pause Button Guide**:  
   - Click the pause button in the top-left corner.

   - Press `L/l` to load your progress.  
   - Press the spacebar to resume the game.  
4. **Input Method**: Ensure your input method is correctly configured.  
5. **Loading Saves**: Press `L` on the start screen to load a saved game.  
6. **Skipping Story**: If replaying and the story feels too long, load a save directly from the start screen to skip it.  
7. **Potion Spawning**: Occasionally, health potions (red) and speed potions (blue) may spawn in the same location. If no health potions appear for a long time, try picking up a blue potion.
